# Client Environment Variables

# Backend API URL (for REST API calls)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Socket.io Server URL (for WebSocket connections)
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Deployment Instructions:
# ========================
# 
# For Production Deployment:
# 1. Replace the URLs above with your deployed backend URL
#    Example: VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
#            VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
# 
# 2. Make sure both URLs point to the same backend server
# 
# 3. Ensure your backend .env has the correct CLIENT_URL pointing to this frontend
# 
# 4. After updating, rebuild your frontend:
#    npm run build
#
# For Vercel/Netlify:
# - Set these as environment variables in the deployment dashboard
# - They will automatically be injected during build time
